Today 20th September will be a great day and awsome night.....

Let me tell you the reason for that today I will be covering all the type-script hand book materials and move to development by MyBlog app...

I will also have to practice how to write the custom files of the MyBlog app that is my favourite part.

I will also lay my hands on the Machine Learning Part and try to cover the sylabuss for the same.

All this will take alot of time but will certainly will be worth it.
